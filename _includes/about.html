After one year, I realized, as my English professor wrote, <i>"Bryan wants to engage with bigger questions"</i>. I decided that software development didn't engage with bigger questions and ultimately transferred to <a href="http://www.elon.edu" target="_blank">Elon University</a> where I double majored in Philosophy and Political Science.</p>

I quickly realized that Data Analysis represented the perfect blend of my skills and passions. A curiousity to ask why, find and produce evidence, and a passion for new and evolving technology. Looking for new challenges and wanting to shift away from Teaching, I've found a new home in the world of Data</p>
