description: This project was done at the start of May 2022 as a full end-to-end portfolio project. The data was a SQL Dump available online. I installed a MariaDB SQL Server on my Raspberry Pi 4, accessed the database over my local network to make various modifications using MySQL Workbench. The data was then accessed, cleaned, and modeled in Tableau. I created a story of a non-existant IT Company called Best Delivery, performed a needs analysis, and created a dashboard according to the imagined needs.<br><br><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/3TJrQPN" target="_blank">CLICK HERE TO SEE THE DASHBOARD</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://bit.ly/3tBRCLU" target="_blank">CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL STORY OF THE PROJECT</a></strong>
