description: This project was done at the start of May 2022 as a full end-to-end portfolio project. The data came from an excel dataset on kaggle.com. The data was then accessed, cleaned, and modeled in Power BI. I created a story of a non-existant e-commerce company called Froglines that delivers workwide. The visualization was designed to respond to a need for a year-to-date report that would be used during monthly sales meetings, analyzing the available data from a variety of angles. The report was made, then published to Power BI Service and finally published to the web for non-authenticated viewing<br><br><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/3Xcpiwx" target="_blank">CLICK HERE TO SEE THE REPORT</a></strong>
